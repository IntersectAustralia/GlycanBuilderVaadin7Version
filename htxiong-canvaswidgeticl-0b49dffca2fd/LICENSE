****Hershey Fonts (org.vaadin.damerell.canvas.font.hershey)****

USE RESTRICTION:
        This distribution of the Hershey Fonts may be used by anyone for
        any purpose, commercial or otherwise, providing that:
                1. The following acknowledgements must be distributed with
                        the font data:
                        - The Hershey Fonts were originally created by Dr.
                                A. V. Hershey while working at the U. S.
                                National Bureau of Standards.
                        - The format of the Font data in this distribution
                                was originally created by
                                        James Hurt
                                        Cognition, Inc.
                                        900 Technology Park Drive
                                        Billerica, MA 01821
                                        (mit-eddie!ci-dandelion!hurt)
                2. The font data in this distribution may be converted into
                        any other format *EXCEPT* the format distributed by
                        the U.S. NTIS (which organization holds the rights
                        to the distribution and use of the font data in that
                        particular format). Not that anybody would really
                        *want* to use their format... each point is described
                        in eight bytes as "xxx yyy:", where xxx and yyy are
                        the coordinate values as ASCII numbers.
